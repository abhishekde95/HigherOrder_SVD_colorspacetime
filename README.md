# HigherOrder_SVD_colorspacetime

Form, Color and Motion are central to indentifying objects and their locations. 
I collected spatiotemporalchromatic (tensor) data from individual macaque V1 cells. I used higher order SVD to linearly separate the time, color and spatial 
component and analyze them.
